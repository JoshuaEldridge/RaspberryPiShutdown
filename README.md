# RaspberryPiShutdown

I've seen many iterations of shutdown scripts that have been written to
allow a single button push to shutdown the device properly (via sudo halt
or sudo shutdown -now). This repository is an attempt to document and retain
the way that works best for my needs. And of course points will be awarded for
style.
